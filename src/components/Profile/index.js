      <h1>Profile</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Alex, a web engineer and designer. I'm currently based in London,
        and working with Monzo where I'm helping build the next generation of
        web banking apps at Monzo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a particular passion for design systems and design tooling,
        having been fortunate enough to work on these problems at my previous
        three companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then I also write articles, including for Awwwards, Web
        Designer Magazine and net Magazine.

        As a web engineer at Monzo, I've led engineering on several high-profile
        projects including Year in Monzo. Likewise, I've helped launch our first
        public web banking app.

      <p>
        Before Monzo, I spent 2 years at Kalo (now Polywork) building products
        to help freelancers and businesses work more seamlessly together.
